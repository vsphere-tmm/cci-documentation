# Welcome to vSphere+ Modern Consumption Experience

*What is the Cloud Consumption Interface:* CCI is a flexible vRealize Automation Cloud-based feature that enables consumers to rapidly create and consume cloud native and traditional IT infrastructure resources. It aggregates and exposes Supervisor DevOps services from across vSphere infrastructure into a common endpoint.

A vSphere+ cloud administrator can activate the Developer Experience service in vSphere+ to 
grant users access to the Cloud Consumption Interface (CCI) in Service Broker. Designated 
users receive access to CCI according to the configuration defined by their administrator. 
Administrators can also use the CCI command line interface to set up infrastructure, such as 
regions, and to configure user access.
